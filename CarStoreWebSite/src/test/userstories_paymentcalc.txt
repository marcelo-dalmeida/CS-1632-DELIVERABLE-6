User Story (PaymentCalculator
    As a general user (either a manager or non-account user)
    I would like to be able to calculate the estimated price of a car
    So that I know how much it would cost me to buy that car with taxes, interest, and other fees included

    Scenarios
        // Given that I have selected a car
    	// And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I don't change any values in the price calculator
    	// Then the correct total price will be calculated for the car for 1 month (0 yrs) with no down-payment
        defaultValues

        // Given that I have selected a car
        // And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I change only the down-payment in the price calculator
        // Then the correct total price will be calculated for the car for 1 month (0 yrs) with the specified down-payment
        changeDownPayment

        // Given that I have selected a car
        // And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I change only the number of years in the price calculator
        // Then the correct total price will be calculated for the car for n * 12 months (n yrs) with no down-payment
        changeNumYears

        // Given that I have selected a car
        // And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I enter non-numeric characters into the down-payment field
        // Then the results fields should be empty/not change (except for "Number of months" which will revert to its default value of 1)

        // And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I enter non-numeric characters into the number of years field

        // Given that I have selected a car
        // And am currently viewing its information page
        // When I enter a negative value into the down-payment field
        // Then the results fields should behave as normal using negative values
